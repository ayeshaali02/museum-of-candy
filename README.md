## 🧠 How It Works

- **Navbar scroll effect:** As the user scrolls, jQuery toggles a `.scrolled` class to change navbar background color.
- **Section layout:** Each row alternates between text and image, creating an engaging zigzag layout.
- **Mobile responsiveness:** Bootstrap’s grid system ensures all content adapts across screen sizes.
- **Typography & color scheme:** Custom color palette of soft pinks and reds reinforce a sweet, candy-themed vibe.
